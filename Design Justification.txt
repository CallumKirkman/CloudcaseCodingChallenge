Design Justification
Regarding the design above, please outline your reasons for the design choices you made:

In regards to the CSS, I went for a simplistic style that would be professional and easy to read.
If presented on a company website or application, the colour and styling would be changed to match.

In actual use, the HTML template would link to wherever the information is needing to be stored or used.
The answers could also easily be linked to the TaxProgram in order to streamline the payroll process.

The inputs I used I feel are the only necessary questions needed for the limited scope of this exercise.
Should the company require more specific inputs, they can be easily added to the HTML.
